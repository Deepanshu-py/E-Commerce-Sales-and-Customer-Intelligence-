# E-Commerce Sales and Customer Intelligence Analysis

## Overview

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of an e-commerce retail dataset to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. It combines Python, SQL, and Power BI to build a complete analytics pipeline from raw data to business insights.

The workflow follows a real-world data analytics process:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Customer segmentation using RFM  
- SQL-based business queries  
- Interactive dashboard visualization  

---

## Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw transactional data  
- Analyze revenue across time, geography, and products  
- Understand customer purchasing behavior  
- Identify high-value and at-risk customers  
- Apply RFM segmentation for customer intelligence  
- Generate actionable business insights  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- SQL Server (SSMS)  
- Power BI  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## How to Run

### 1. Python Analysis

- Open the notebook:
- notebooks/Ecommerce_sales_customer_datacleaning_eda.ipynb

- - Run all cells step by step  
- This will:
- Clean the dataset  
- Create features (Revenue, Month)  
- Perform EDA  
- Generate RFM table  

---

### 2. SQL Analysis

- Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Create or use database: retail_sales_analysis

- - Import cleaned data  
- Run queries from: Ecommmerce_sales_customer_sql_eda.sql

---

### 3. Power BI Dashboard

- Open:dashboard/Ecommerce_sales_dashboard.pbix

- - Refresh data if required  
- Use filters (Year, Country, Month) to explore  

- Refresh dataset if needed  
- Use filters (Year, Country, Month) to explore insights

## Key Insights

- Revenue is highly concentrated in the United Kingdom  
- Sales show strong seasonality with peaks in November and December  
- A small percentage of customers contributes the majority of revenue (Pareto principle)  
- Customer retention is weak, with multiple one-time buyers  
- High-value customers exist within the lost segment  
- Product demand is dominated by home décor and gift items  
- Both bulk buyers (B2B) and regular customers (B2C) are present  

---

## Business Value

This project demonstrates how data can be used to:
- Improve customer retention  
- Identify high-value customers  
- Optimize product strategy  
- Support data-driven decision-making
